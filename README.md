# `multifootnote` - Multiple numbers for the same footnote

The package `multifootnote` provides several commands for generating footnotes which correspond to multiple footnote numbers (or marks, if you prefer).

In some cases, you may wish for certain footnotes to correspond to several places in your text. The traditional solution usually involves writing the same footnote mark multiple times at the corresponding places. However, this approach makes it difficult to see at once how many times a footnote has been referred to. Therefore, the current package proposes another method: writing the footnote marks in linear order, and allowing a footnote text to match several of these marks.
